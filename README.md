# Project Description
It is developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript. For completion of this website we have used some of the core azure services such as Static Webapps, Visual Studio Code.

Deployment can be viewed here:

For deploying a static webapp using Azure Static web app service we have to make a resource group in my case it was "Rohit More Portfolio" and connect to github account in order to access repositories. Azure creates a github actions .yaml file in ".github/Workflows/ " which automatically detects a new commit and run a github actions workflow and the changes reflects on the actual website.

For more details on the deployment process watch this video demo I created :
